# Enchantments

Minecraft enchantments modify game mechanics by altering item behavior, applying effects or changing damage calculations. Kore provides a fully type‐safe, Kotlin-based DSL for creating custom enchantments that can be used in datapacks. This documentation explains how to create enchantments in Kore, and presents a detailed example for every available enchantment effect.

For general concepts on creating datapacks with Kore, please refer to the other documentation pages (e.g. [Predicates](./predicates), [Components](./components)). This article is dedicated exclusively to creating enchantments.

## Basic Enchantment Creation

Creating an enchantment in Kore is as simple as calling the `enchantment` function inside a data pack. A basic enchantment is defined by its description, what items it supports, and additional properties such as exclusive sets, primary items, and equipment slots.

For example:

```kotlin
dataPack("my_datapack") {
    enchantment("test") {
        description("This is a test enchantment.")
        exclusiveSet(Tags.Enchantment.IN_ENCHANTING_TABLE)
        supportedItems(Items.DIAMOND_SWORD, Items.DIAMOND_AXE)
        primaryItems(Tags.Item.AXES)
        slots(EquipmentSlot.MAINHAND, EquipmentSlot.OFFHAND)
    }
}
```

This snippet creates a simple enchantment named “test” that can be applied to a diamond sword or axe, with additional restrictions on the type of items and slots.

## Enchantment Effects

An enchantment’s power is defined in the `effects` block. Kore supports a wide range of effects – each affecting a different aspect of gameplay. You can combine multiple effects by using functions within the `effects { ... }` builder. Below is an exhaustive list of every supported enchantment effect along with a precise Kotlin example.

### Attributes

Modifies or adds attribute modifiers to items. For example, increasing an item’s scale.

```kotlin
enchantment("attributes") {
    effects {
        attributes {
            attribute("my_modifier", name, Attributes.SCALE, AttributeModifierOperation.ADD_VALUE, 5)
        }
    }
}
```

### Armor Effectiveness

Modifies the effectiveness of armor when the enchantment is active.

```kotlin
enchantment("armor_effectiveness") {
    effects {
        armorEffectiveness {
            add(5) {
                requirements {
                    weatherCheck(raining = true)
                }
            }
            allOf {
                add(5)
                allOf {
                    add(5)
                }
            }
            multiply(2)
            removeBinomial(2)
            set(2)
        }
    }
}
```

### Block Experience

Calculates and awards experience based on block-related factors using a combination of level-based providers. This effect demonstrates the DSL’s advanced capabilities by combining several sub-effects:

```kotlin
enchantment("block_experience") {
    effects {
        blockExperience {
            allOf {
                add(clampedLevelBased(5, 0.0, 10.0))
                add(constantLevelBased(5))
                add(fractionLevelBased(1, 5))
                add(levelsSquaredLevelBased(2))
                add(linearLevelBased(2, 2))
                add(lookupLevelBased(2, 2, fallback = 2))
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Crossbow Charging Sounds

Changes the sounds produced when a crossbow is charged.

```kotlin
enchantment("crossbow_charging_sounds") {
    effects {
        crossbowChargingSounds {
            crossbowChargingSound {
                start(SoundEvents.Item.Crossbow.QUICK_CHARGE_3)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Crossbow Charge Time

Alters the time required to charge a crossbow.

```kotlin
enchantment("crossbow_charge_time") {
    effects {
        crossbowChargeTime {
            add(5)
        }
    }
}
```

### Damage

Applies an additional damage effect when the enchanted item is used.

```kotlin
enchantment("damage") {
    effects {
        damage {
            add(5)
        }
    }
}
```

### Damage Immunity

Gives temporary immunity from damage; can also trigger a sound effect when activated.

```kotlin
enchantment("damage_immunity") {
    effects {
        damageImmunity {
            sound {
                requirements {
                    weatherCheck(raining = true)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Equipment Drops

Modifies the probability and quantity of equipment drops when an entity is defeated.

```kotlin
enchantment("equipment_drops") {
    effects {
        equipmentDrops {
            add(EquipmentDropsSpecifier.ATTACKER, 5) {
                requirements {
                    weatherCheck(raining = true)
                }
            }
            allOf(EquipmentDropsSpecifier.VICTIM) {
                add(5)
                allOf {
                    add(5)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Fishing Luck Bonus

Increases luck when fishing.

```kotlin
enchantment("fishing_luck_bonus") {
    effects {
        fishingLuckBonus {
            add(5)
        }
    }
}
```

### Fishing Time Reduction

Reduces the time required to catch fish.

```kotlin
enchantment("fishing_time_reduction") {
    effects {
        fishingTimeReduction {
            add(5)
        }
    }
}
```

### Hit Block

A multifaceted effect triggered when the enchanted item is used to hit a block. It supports many sub-effects including applying mob effects, damaging entities, modifying item durability, explosions, igniting blocks, playing sounds, changing block states, and summoning particles or entities.

```kotlin
enchantment("hit_block") {
    effects {
        hitBlock {
            allOf {
                applyMobEffect(Effects.SPEED) {
                    maxDuration(2)
                    minAmplifier(1)
                }
                requirements {
                    weatherCheck(raining = true)
                }
            }
            damageEntity(DamageTypes.IN_FIRE, 1, 2) {
                requirements {
                    weatherCheck(raining = false)
                }
            }

                sound = Sounds.Random.FUSE
            ) {
                radius(2)
            }
            ignite(2)
            playSound(SoundEvents.Entity.FireworkRocket.LAUNCH, 5f)
            replaceBlock(simpleStateProvider(Blocks.DIAMOND_BLOCK)) {
                offset(5, 5, 5)
                triggerGameEvent = GameEvents.BLOCK_PLACE
            }
            replaceDisk(simpleStateProvider(Blocks.DIAMOND_BLOCK)) {
                radius(5)
                height(2)
            }
            runFunction(FunctionArgument("function", "namespace"))
            setBlockProperties {
                properties {
                    this["test"] = "test"
                }
            }
            spawnParticles(
                Particles.ANGRY_VILLAGER,
                horizontalPositionType = ParticlePositionType.IN_BOUNDING_BOX,
                verticalPositionType = ParticlePositionType.IN_BOUNDING_BOX,
            ) {
                horizontalVelocity(base = 2.5f, movementScale = 1.2f)

                }
            }
            damageEntity(PostAttackSpecifier.VICTIM, PostAttackSpecifier.DAMAGING_ENTITY, DamageTypes.IN_FIRE, 1, 2)
